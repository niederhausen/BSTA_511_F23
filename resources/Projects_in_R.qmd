* I *highly, highly* recommend using R projects to organize your analyses and make it easier to load data files and also save output.
* When you create an R project on your computer, the project is associated with the folder (directory) you created it in. 
  * This folder becomes the location of the R workspace you're working in, and RStudio's point of reference from where to load files from and save files to. 
* I create separate projects for every analysis or homework assignment (and hence separate folders to store them in).
* You can run multiple sessions of RStudio by opening different projects, and the environments (or workspaces) of each are working independently of each other. 


# Learn more about projects and why you should *always* be using them

Below are various resources to learn more about RStudio "projects."

    * From R-bloggers website
    * TOC
        * What is a RStudio project, and why?
        * Easy file path referencing with RStudio projects
