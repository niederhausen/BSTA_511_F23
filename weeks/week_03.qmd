## Recordings

* __Pre-recorded__ lessons are on Echo Cloud (aka echo 360 or echo video).
    * These can be accessed in Sakai by navigating to the BSTA 511/611 page and clicking on the `Echo Cloud` option in the left-side menu. 
    * This will redirect you to an echo video page with a list of pre-recorded videos.
* __In-class__ recording links are on Sakai. Navigate to _Course Materials_ -> _Schedule with links to in-class recordings_. Note that the password to the recordings is at the top of the page.

## Homework

    * Covers Days 3-5

    * Covers Days 6-7

### Why is `{.unnumbered}` included at the end of some of the section headers on the HW?

* I added the option for the sections to be numbered in the YAML (`number-sections: true`) so that the R exercises at the end of the file are numbered. 
* However, the book exercises already have their own numbering, and so I added `{.unnumbered}` to the section headers of the book exercises so that they are not numbered twice.
