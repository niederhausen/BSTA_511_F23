## Homework

    * Covers Days 14-15
    * For book exercises, make sure to include all steps in a hypothesis test (where applicable) as outlined in the class notes. 
    * Do not forget to include a discussion on whether you think the test conditions have been satisfied. Are there assumptions you need to make in order for them to be satisfied? Whether you believe they are satisfied or not, continue to run the hypothesis test as instructed.
